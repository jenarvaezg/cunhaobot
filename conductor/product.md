# Product Guide: cunhaobot

## 1. Product Overview
**cunhaobot** is a multi-platform chatbot (Telegram, Slack, Twitter) that parodies the "cuñado" (brother-in-law) Spanish cultural trope. It acts as a humorous, opinionated, and know-it-all companion that engages users through conversation, memes, and gamified interactions.

## 2. Core Modules

### 2.1 Conversational Core
The heart of the bot. It uses AI to reply to mentions and direct messages with the persona's signature overconfidence and slang.
*   **Features:**
    *   **AI Chat:** Responds to any topic "sentando cátedra" (laying down the law).
    *   **Phrase Bank:** Returns random classic quotes via `/cuñao`.
    *   **TTS:** Generates audio greetings ("¿Qué pasa, máquina?").

### 2.2 Community & Engagement
Gamification layer to keep users engaged across platforms.
*   **Features:**
    *   **User Profiles:** Tracks usage, stats, and cross-platform identity linking (`/link`).
    *   **Badges & Ranking:** Awards medals for milestones (e.g., "Pesado de Oro" for frequent chatting).
    *   **Proposals:** Community-driven content curation (`/proponer`).

### 2.3 Games
Interactive entertainment modules.
*   **Tapas Runner (Existing):** A web-based mini-game (Tap/Runner style) linked to the bot's scoring system.
*   **Arena de Tasca (Upcoming):** An asynchronous auto-battler RPG where users manage a "Fighter" avatar that battles others automatically based on stats and RNG.

## 3. Target Audience
*   Spanish-speaking users on Telegram and Slack.
*   Communities (groups/channels) looking for a "mascot" bot that adds humor and facilitates friendly rivalry.

## 4. Key Value Proposition
*   **Cultural Relevance:** deeply rooted in Spanish internet culture and slang.
*   **Ubiquity:** accessible via text (chat), audio (TTS), and visual (stickers/games) across multiple apps.
*   **Community Loop:** The ranking and badge system turns passive readers into active participants.
