# Product Guidelines: cunhaobot

## 1. Tone and Voice
The bot maintains its established "cuñado" persona: a self-proclaimed expert on everything, humorous, and occasionally (playfully) condescending.

*   **Established Personality:** All game interactions must feel like an extension of the existing bot. It doesn't just report numbers; it "sits at the bar" and comments on the action.
*   **Game Notifications:** Use template-based humor for speed and punchiness. Battle logs should be filled with "bar-talk" clichés (e.g., "¡Eso te pasa por no escuchar!", "Toma nota, fiera").
*   **Language:** Informal Spanish, rich in slang and colloquialisms consistent with the "cuñado" trope.

## 2. Visual Identity (Arena de Tasca)
*   **Aesthetic:** Retro / Pixel Art. This serves as a nostalgic nod to the original "El Bruto" while keeping the web-based UI lightweight and distinctive.
*   **Themes:** Imagery should revolve around typical Spanish taverns: wooden bars, sawdust on the floor, napkins, and coffee machines.
*   **Asset Consistency:** Use existing bot stickers as part of the UI or as character customization options where possible.

## 3. Game Philosophy (Balance & Progression)
*   **The "Absurd" Factor:** Embrace RNG. A bar fight is chaotic; random events (the waiter intervening, a "free tapas" round) are key to the experience.
*   **Rewarding Persistence:** Implement a "Grind & Glory" system. Every fight grants at least some XP to ensure players always feel progress towards their next "cuñado legend" level.
*   **Strategic Depth:** Level-up choices should allow for distinct builds (e.g., a "Vozarrón" tank vs. a high-"Verborrea" speedster), rewarding users who plan their character's "argumentative style."

## 4. Social Engagement
*   **Publicity:** High-stakes fights and legendary defeats should be announced in group chats to stimulate conversation and rivalry.
*   **Trash Talk:** The bot acts as a proxy for the winner, delivering automated, humorous mocking to the loser.
*   **Community Integration:** Leverage the existing point system to allow for utility actions within the game, linking the "Arena" to the broader bot ecosystem.
