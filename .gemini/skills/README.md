# Agent Skills & Guidelines

This directory contains the core development skills and patterns for the **cunhaobot** project. All agents working on this repository MUST follow these instructions.

## Core Guides

- [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md): Core Python 3.14+ philosophy and toolchain (uv, ruff, pytest).
- [PATTERNS.md](./PATTERNS.md): Idiomatic Python patterns (Protocols, Guard Clauses, Type Hints).
- [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md): Testing standards using pytest and async testing.
- [CLI.md](./CLI.md): Patterns for building and maintaining CLI tools.

## Instructions for Agents

1. **Consult these files** before starting any coding task.
2. **Adhere strictly** to the "Flat Control Flow" and "No Any" rules.
3. **Use the specified toolchain** (`uv`, `ruff`, `ty`, `pytest`).
4. **Maintain the Protocol-based architecture** for dependency injection.
